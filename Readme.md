System Architecture Overview Description

To meet the requirements, the system must be designed to process high event volumes (millions of events per second) efficiently while keeping resource usage, particularly memory, constant. 

This is achieved by using a sliding window to count events within a specified timeframe (e.g., 5 minutes) and ensuring that memory usage remains constant regardless of the number of events.

Key Features
Sliding Window: Maintain a count of events within a time window (e.g., last 5 minutes).
Constant Memory Usage: Memory usage should not grow with the event volume.
High Throughput: Handle millions of events per second without performance degradation.


System Design
1. Event Producer: This is the system or function responsible for generating events.

2. Sliding Window Mechanism:

a. Fixed-size Time Buckets: the  time window is divided into a series of fixed-sized time buckets (e.g., 1 second each). Each bucket stores the count of events that occurred within that second. This allows us to track the event count efficiently while keeping memory usage constant.

b. Circular Buffer: The fixed-size time buckets are stored in a circular buffer, with the buffer size determined by the number of seconds in the sliding window. For example, a 5-minute window with 1-second precision would require a buffer with 300 slots. As time progresses, old buckets are overwritten, keeping memory usage constant.

3. Event Consumer:
For each incoming event, the system updates the current time bucket in the circular buffer.
Whenever an event count is needed (e.g., the number of events in the last 5 minutes), the system sums the event counts in the sliding window by aggregating the counts across the appropriate buckets in the circular buffer.

Data Structures
Circular Buffer:
A circular buffer (list) to store the number of events for each time bucket.
An index pointer that indicates the current time bucket.
Each bucket holds the count of events that occurred during that specific time interval.

Timestamp Mapping:
A timestamp-based mapping to ensure that buckets correspond to the correct time intervals.

Algorithms
Event Insertion Algorithm:
Upon receiving a new event, calculate the current time in seconds.
Determine the appropriate bucket in the circular buffer using the current time modulo the buffer size.
If the bucket corresponds to an outdated time interval, reset the bucket count to zero before incrementing it.


Sliding Window Event Count Algorithm:
To retrieve the number of events in the sliding window, sum the counts in all the buckets in the circular buffer.
This operation takes a constant amount of time (O(N)) where N is the number of buckets, which is fixed (e.g., 300 for a 5-minute window with 1-second precision).
